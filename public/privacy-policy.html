  <h1>Privacy Policy – Duunda Music</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [You can update this date when you change the policy.]</p>

  <p>Duunda Music ("we", "our", "the app") respects your privacy. This policy describes how we handle information in the Duunda Music mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information we collect and why</h2>
  <p>We collect only what is needed to provide the service:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account information</strong> – email, name, and password (stored securely) to create and manage your account.</li>
    <li><strong>Profile picture</strong> – If you set a profile photo, we use your device’s <strong>camera</strong> and/or <strong>photo library</strong> only to let you choose or take a picture. That image is uploaded to our servers to display as your profile picture in the app. We do not use it for any other purpose.</li>
    <li><strong>Music and usage</strong> – Playlists, listening activity, and preferences to provide the music experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Permissions (Android / iOS)</h2>
  <p>The app may request:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera</strong> – Only to take a new profile picture. We do not access the camera at any other time.</li>
    <li><strong>Photo library / storage</strong> – Only to let you choose an existing photo as your profile picture. We do not access other files or photos.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can deny these permissions; the app will still work, but you will not be able to set a profile picture.</p>

  <h2>3. How we use and store data</h2>
  <p>Profile pictures and account data are stored on our servers and used only to operate the app (e.g. showing your profile and avatar). We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Contact</h2>
  <p>For privacy-related questions, contact us at the support email or address provided in the app or on our website.</p>
